## Overview

## Objectives

In this exercise, we will learn how to perform geospatial data science tasks in R by using **sf** package.

We aim to achieve the following competencies:

-   installing and loading [sf](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/) and [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) packages into R environment;
-   importing geospatial data by using appropriate functions of **sf** package;
-   importing aspatial data by using appropriate function of **readr** package;
-   exploring the content of simple feature data frame by using appropriate **Base R** and **sf** functions;
-   assigning or transforming coordinate systems by using using appropriate *sf* functions;
-   converting an aspatial data into a sf data frame by using appropriate function of **sf** package;
-   performing geoprocessing tasks by using appropriate functions of **sf** package;
-   performing data wrangling tasks by using appropriate functions of **dplyr** package and
-   performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) by using appropriate functions from **ggplot2** package.
